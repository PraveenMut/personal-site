Hi There! I'm Praveen, born and raised in Melbourne. I've generally been interested in the elegance of systems and their interactions between different entities. 

This originally led to me study Economics and Finance which helped me appreciate the inner intriciacies of value, exchange, market microstructure and the diverse schools of thought on resource allocation.

I made the pivot to technology in 2019 after I fell in love with development and I'm now a DevOps Engineer at IOOF Holdings after completing a 6 months intensive bootcamp at Coder Academy. We're a small team, so we wear a few hats developing and managing an internal PaaS for development and operations teams to use. The overarching goal is to provide a clean and simple abstraction for developers to effortlessly deploy their workloads to any sort of infrastructure.

It's been a deeply fascinating journey for me personally. I've built a variety of Puppet, Ansible and Terraform code on the operational side as well as bespoke Ruby, Bash, Docker and a bit of Go on the development side for our platforms. However, tools are tools and are nothing without the advocation of DevOps practices and philosophies to our clients.

I have a strong enthusiasm for learning and I've been working on honing my Cloud, Kubernetes, Golang and Ruby skills. I've also had a curiosity for reproducible builds and FP, including Nix.
